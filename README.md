This project is a calculator for investors and bankers to use to calculate what 
the end amount would be depending on the initial investment, interest rate,
and monthly payment after a certain amount of time.

I feel like I did the organization fairly well, I did keep the main of this 
program short and sweet, and put the bulk of the program and it's calculations
in the functions.

I could definitely streamline the code itself. I feel like the code itself, even 
though it works, could be streamlined for ultimate efficiency, such as putting the 
input menu in it's own function, which would cut down on the clutter of the code

The most challenging for me was trying to format everything. Trying to center everything 
and make sure it was aesthetically pleasing has always been a struggle for me, so I think
I improved a bit, but it was still a struggle.

The skills from this project that will be transferrable to other projects and coursework
will definitely be knowing how and when to split code into functions in order to provide 
less clutter in the main of the programs, and it'll be a lot easier for other programmers
who might need to make changes to my code to follow along.

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by breaking everything down into
functions for specific uses, that are easy to follow along what they should be doing. I 
should have put more comments in, but that goes back to improvements that I can make in future
programs
